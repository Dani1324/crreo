  <h1>Terms of service</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h4>Last Revised: April 04, 2023</h4>
    <h2>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and <strong>CRREO</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”),
    concerning your use of our website and its professional networking features, payment platform, and collaboration and
    marketing tools (collectively the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the opportunities we provide users to create, market, and sell access to
    created content (referred to hereafter as “<strong>Content Creators</strong>”) or persons seeking to purchase access to such content or
    solicit the services of Content Creators (referred to hereafter as “<strong>Members</strong>”), with the Site and the aforementioned
    feature and services collectively referred to herein as our “<strong>Services</strong>”. Content Creators and Members may each be
    referred to herein as a “<strong>User</strong>” or collectively be referred to herein as “<strong>Users</strong>”.<br><br>
    
    You agree that, by beginning or continuing to receive or make use of the Site and/or our Services as a User, you have
    read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”), our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy,
    and, if applicable, the Membership Agreement with respect to our Personal Membership License (“<strong>PML</strong>”) Program
    (collectively the “<strong>User Agreement</strong>”). If you do not agree with the User Agreement in its entirety, your only recourse is
    to forego or cease use or receipt of the Site and our Services.<br><br>
    
    The Site and our Services are intended for Users who are at least eighteen (18) years old. Persons under the age of
    eighteen (18) are not permitted to use the Site or our Services.</p>
    <h2>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you, to change the Terms of Service
    or other components of the User Agreement under which your enjoyment of the Services is governed. The most current
    version of the User Agreement will supersede all previous versions. We encourage you to periodically review the Terms of
    Service and other User Agreement documents to stay informed of our most current policies. As the Site is currently in
    the active development stage, these Terms are more likely to change frequently.</p>
    <h2>SERVICES DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Our Services vary based on your role. For example, if you are a Content Creator, our Services may include allowing you
    to (i) create a Content Creator profile on the Site, (ii) use our advanced analytics, marketing, and content
    creation/editing tools, (iii) respond to requests by Members for more information about the content you create, (iv)
    offer and sell Private Membership Licenses to Members, (v) manage active PMLs, (vi) publish custom content for enjoyment
    and use by Members, and (vi) engage with or be engaged by Members, whether or not holders of PMLs, to provide custom
    content creation.<br><br>
    
    If you are a Member, our services may include allowing you to (i) create a user profile on the Site, (ii) search for and
    discover Content Creators whose content types, either in whole or in part, your search criteria, (iii) communicate with
    a Content Creator, (iv) purchase PMLs, whether newly issued or secondarily from other Members, (v) receive and enjoy
    content produced by Content Creators for the benefit of their Members, and (vi) engage a Content Creator for purposes of
    receiving or creating custom content.<br><br>
    
    Our Services may also include one or more tiers of paid subscriptions (hereafter “<strong>Subscriptions</strong>”, with each a
    “<strong>Subscription</strong>”) for Members to be able to receive and enjoy content created by their Members, with costs listed on each
    Content Creator’s profile on the Site and subject to change, that grant access to premium content created by Content
    Creators and not fully accessible to or enjoyable by the general public (the “<strong>Subscriber Features</strong>”). We reserve the
    right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to create, eliminate, or modify Subscriber Features and may, from time to
    time, make certain Subscriber Features available to the general public on either a temporary or permanent basis. We
    shall not be liable to any Content Creators or Members for changes to the Site, the Subscriber Features, or other
    features of the Site that may impact the profitability of Content Creators or the experience and enjoyment of Users.</p>
    <h2>CONTENT CREATOR DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>We do not vet the qualifications of Content Creators or the quality of the content they create. We make no
    representations or warranties about any Content Creator or that Content Creator’s business activities, qualifications,
    or fitness for any particular purpose.</p>
    <h2>RESPONSIBILITY FOR USER CONDUCT</h2>
    <p>While our Services and Site are designed to facilitate the engagement of Content Creators by Members, we do not screen
    or evaluate the demands of Members or qualifications of Content Creators, and we shall have no liability for the conduct
    of any Member or Content Creator and the consequences or harms realized by any User or third party arising or resulting
    therefrom. For example and without limitation, we shall not be liable in the event that a Content Creator (i) fails to
    provide the content or services for which a Member or third party engages them, (ii) provides content or services to a
    Member or third party that are inadequate, substandard, or otherwise unacceptable, or (iii) harms a Member, third party,
    or other Content Creator through any act(s) or omission(s), regardless of whether the same are the result of negligence,
    gross negligence, recklessness, intentional misconduct, or otherwise. By using our Site and our Services, you understand
    and acknowledge that you may consult with your own legal counsel of choice prior to your use of the Site or receipt of
    the Services, and you agree that you shall be solely responsible for your conduct and the consequences thereof and that
    you shall release, defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from the same.</p>
    <h2>NON-EMPLOYMENT DISCLOSURE</h2>
    <p><strong><u>CRREO does not employ Content Creators</u></strong>. CRREO is not responsible for and will not be liable for workers’ compensation
    insurance coverage or any tax payments or withholdings, including, without limitation, sales tax, unemployment or
    employment insurance, social security, disability insurance or any other applicable federal or state withholdings in
    connection with any Member’s or Content Creator’s use of the Site.<br><br>
    
    CONTENT CREATORS ARE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MAY USE THE SITE TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH MEMBERS. CONTENT
    CREATORS ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS,
    INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, OR FRANCHISEES OF CRREO. BY CONNECTING MEMBERS WITH CONTENT CREATORS, CRREO OPERATES AS AN
    ONLINE MARKETPLACE.<br><br>
    
    YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CRREO DOES NOT SUPERVISE, SCOPE, DIRECT, CONTROL, OR MONITOR ANY MEMBER’S OR CONTENT
    CREATOR’S SOLICITATIONS, CONTENT, OR WORK, AND CRREO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY
    RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE CONTENT OR WORK DEMANDED OF OR RENDERED BY CONTENT CREATORS IN ANY MANNER,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF
    QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, OR CODE,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE PERTAINING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.<br><br>
    
    Any reference on the Site to a particular Content Creator being matched to a Member’s tastes or preferences is not a
    representation of CRREO. Rather, any such reference is a representation of a Content Creator that its areas of focus,
    expertise, reach, following, or other qualifications align with the needs or wants of the searching Member. Any such
    reference is not an endorsement, certification, or guarantee by CRREO of such Content Creator’s skills or qualifications
    or whether they are suitable for that Member’s goals or desires. Instead, any such reference is intended to be useful
    information for Members to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the suitability of Content Creators with
    whom they interact via the Site.<br><br>
    
    The Site enables connections between Content Creators and Members to allow Members to patronize the content of the
    Content Creators and to engage the Content Creators for the creation of custom content. CRREO is not responsible for the
    performance or communications of Content Creators or Members, nor does it have control over the quality, veracity,
    timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the information provided by Content Creators or
    Members, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever
    of any Content Creators or Members, or of any ratings or reviews provided by Content Creators or Members with respect to
    each other. CRREO makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of
    the communications of or between Members or Content Creators identified through the Site, whether in public or private,
    via on- or off-line interactions, or otherwise howsoever.<br><br>
    No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and us is
    intended or created by these Terms of Service, the Services provided by Us, or your use of the Site.</p>
    <h2>PML DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>PMLS ARE NOT REGISTERED SECURITIES UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND SECTION 12(G) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. PMLS ARE
    NOT OWNERSHIP OR MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN CRREO. BY ISSUING (AS CONTENT CREATORS) OR PURCHASING (AS MEMBERS) A PML, YOU
    ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE UNIQUE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN OUR CRREO MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY
    UNIQUE CONDITIONS SET FORTH BY THE ISSUING CONTENT CREATORS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR
    ANY HARMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OF RESULTING FROM A DISPUTE BETWEEN A PML HOLDER (A MEMBER) AND A PML ISSUER (A CONTENT
    CREATOR).</p>
