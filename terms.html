  <h1>Terms of service</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h4>Last Revised: April 04, 2023</h4>
    <h2>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and CRREO (“we”, “us”, or “our”),
    concerning your use of our website and its professional networking features, payment platform, and collaboration and
    marketing tools (collectively the “Site”) and the opportunities we provide users to create, market, and sell access to
    created content (referred to hereafter as “Content Creators”) or persons seeking to purchase access to such content or
    solicit the services of Content Creators (referred to hereafter as “Members”), with the Site and the aforementioned
    feature and services collectively referred to herein as our “Services”. Content Creators and Members may each be
    referred to herein as a “User” or collectively be referred to herein as “Users”.
    
    You agree that, by beginning or continuing to receive or make use of the Site and/or our Services as a User, you have
    read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “Terms”), our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy,
    and, if applicable, the Membership Agreement with respect to our Personal Membership License (“PML”) Program
    (collectively the “User Agreement”). If you do not agree with the User Agreement in its entirety, your only recourse is
    to forego or cease use or receipt of the Site and our Services.
    
    The Site and our Services are intended for Users who are at least eighteen (18) years old. Persons under the age of
    eighteen (18) are not permitted to use the Site or our Services.</p>
    <h2>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you, to change the Terms of Service
    or other components of the User Agreement under which your enjoyment of the Services is governed. The most current
    version of the User Agreement will supersede all previous versions. We encourage you to periodically review the Terms of
    Service and other User Agreement documents to stay informed of our most current policies. As the Site is currently in
    the active development stage, these Terms are more likely to change frequently.</p>
    <h2>SERVICES DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Our Services vary based on your role. For example, if you are a Content Creator, our Services may include allowing you
    to (i) create a Content Creator profile on the Site, (ii) use our advanced analytics, marketing, and content
    creation/editing tools, (iii) respond to requests by Members for more information about the content you create, (iv)
    offer and sell Private Membership Licenses to Members, (v) manage active PMLs, (vi) publish custom content for enjoyment
    and use by Members, and (vi) engage with or be engaged by Members, whether or not holders of PMLs, to provide custom
    content creation.
    
    If you are a Member, our services may include allowing you to (i) create a user profile on the Site, (ii) search for and
    discover Content Creators whose content types, either in whole or in part, your search criteria, (iii) communicate with
    a Content Creator, (iv) purchase PMLs, whether newly issued or secondarily from other Members, (v) receive and enjoy
    content produced by Content Creators for the benefit of their Members, and (vi) engage a Content Creator for purposes of
    receiving or creating custom content.
    
    Our Services may also include one or more tiers of paid subscriptions (hereafter “Subscriptions”, with each a
    “Subscription”) for Members to be able to receive and enjoy content created by their Members, with costs listed on each
    Content Creator’s profile on the Site and subject to change, that grant access to premium content created by Content
    Creators and not fully accessible to or enjoyable by the general public (the “Subscriber Features”). We reserve the
    right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to create, eliminate, or modify Subscriber Features and may, from time to
    time, make certain Subscriber Features available to the general public on either a temporary or permanent basis. We
    shall not be liable to any Content Creators or Members for changes to the Site, the Subscriber Features, or other
    features of the Site that may impact the profitability of Content Creators or the experience and enjoyment of Users.</p>
