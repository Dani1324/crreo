  <h1>Terms of service</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h4>Last Revised: April 04, 2023</h4>
    <h2>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and <strong>CRREO</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”),
    concerning your use of our website and its professional networking features, payment platform, and collaboration and
    marketing tools (collectively the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the opportunities we provide users to create, market, and sell access to
    created content (referred to hereafter as “<strong>Content Creators</strong>”) or persons seeking to purchase access to such content or
    solicit the services of Content Creators (referred to hereafter as “<strong>Members</strong>”), with the Site and the aforementioned
    feature and services collectively referred to herein as our “<strong>Services</strong>”. Content Creators and Members may each be
    referred to herein as a “<strong>User</strong>” or collectively be referred to herein as “<strong>Users</strong>”.<br><br>
    
    You agree that, by beginning or continuing to receive or make use of the Site and/or our Services as a User, you have
    read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”), our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy,
    and, if applicable, the Membership Agreement with respect to our Personal Membership License (“<strong>PML</strong>”) Program
    (collectively the “<strong>User Agreement</strong>”). If you do not agree with the User Agreement in its entirety, your only recourse is
    to forego or cease use or receipt of the Site and our Services.<br><br>
    
    The Site and our Services are intended for Users who are at least eighteen (18) years old. Persons under the age of
    eighteen (18) are not permitted to use the Site or our Services.</p>
    <h2>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you, to change the Terms of Service
    or other components of the User Agreement under which your enjoyment of the Services is governed. The most current
    version of the User Agreement will supersede all previous versions. We encourage you to periodically review the Terms of
    Service and other User Agreement documents to stay informed of our most current policies. As the Site is currently in
    the active development stage, these Terms are more likely to change frequently.</p>
    <h2>SERVICES DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Our Services vary based on your role. For example, if you are a Content Creator, our Services may include allowing you
    to (i) create a Content Creator profile on the Site, (ii) use our advanced analytics, marketing, and content
    creation/editing tools, (iii) respond to requests by Members for more information about the content you create, (iv)
    offer and sell Private Membership Licenses to Members, (v) manage active PMLs, (vi) publish custom content for enjoyment
    and use by Members, and (vi) engage with or be engaged by Members, whether or not holders of PMLs, to provide custom
    content creation.<br><br>
    
    If you are a Member, our services may include allowing you to (i) create a user profile on the Site, (ii) search for and
    discover Content Creators whose content types, either in whole or in part, your search criteria, (iii) communicate with
    a Content Creator, (iv) purchase PMLs, whether newly issued or secondarily from other Members, (v) receive and enjoy
    content produced by Content Creators for the benefit of their Members, and (vi) engage a Content Creator for purposes of
    receiving or creating custom content.<br><br>
    
    Our Services may also include one or more tiers of paid subscriptions (hereafter “<strong>Subscriptions</strong>”, with each a
    “<strong>Subscription</strong>”) for Members to be able to receive and enjoy content created by their Members, with costs listed on each
    Content Creator’s profile on the Site and subject to change, that grant access to premium content created by Content
    Creators and not fully accessible to or enjoyable by the general public (the “<strong>Subscriber Features</strong>”). We reserve the
    right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to create, eliminate, or modify Subscriber Features and may, from time to
    time, make certain Subscriber Features available to the general public on either a temporary or permanent basis. We
    shall not be liable to any Content Creators or Members for changes to the Site, the Subscriber Features, or other
    features of the Site that may impact the profitability of Content Creators or the experience and enjoyment of Users.</p>
    <h2>CONTENT CREATOR DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>We do not vet the qualifications of Content Creators or the quality of the content they create. We make no
    representations or warranties about any Content Creator or that Content Creator’s business activities, qualifications,
    or fitness for any particular purpose.</p>
    <h2>RESPONSIBILITY FOR USER CONDUCT</h2>
    <p>While our Services and Site are designed to facilitate the engagement of Content Creators by Members, we do not screen
    or evaluate the demands of Members or qualifications of Content Creators, and we shall have no liability for the conduct
    of any Member or Content Creator and the consequences or harms realized by any User or third party arising or resulting
    therefrom. For example and without limitation, we shall not be liable in the event that a Content Creator (i) fails to
    provide the content or services for which a Member or third party engages them, (ii) provides content or services to a
    Member or third party that are inadequate, substandard, or otherwise unacceptable, or (iii) harms a Member, third party,
    or other Content Creator through any act(s) or omission(s), regardless of whether the same are the result of negligence,
    gross negligence, recklessness, intentional misconduct, or otherwise. By using our Site and our Services, you understand
    and acknowledge that you may consult with your own legal counsel of choice prior to your use of the Site or receipt of
    the Services, and you agree that you shall be solely responsible for your conduct and the consequences thereof and that
    you shall release, defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from the same.</p>
    <h2>NON-EMPLOYMENT DISCLOSURE</h2>
    <p><strong><u>CRREO does not employ Content Creators</u></strong>. CRREO is not responsible for and will not be liable for workers’ compensation
    insurance coverage or any tax payments or withholdings, including, without limitation, sales tax, unemployment or
    employment insurance, social security, disability insurance or any other applicable federal or state withholdings in
    connection with any Member’s or Content Creator’s use of the Site.<br><br>
    
    CONTENT CREATORS ARE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MAY USE THE SITE TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH MEMBERS. CONTENT
    CREATORS ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS,
    INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, OR FRANCHISEES OF CRREO. BY CONNECTING MEMBERS WITH CONTENT CREATORS, CRREO OPERATES AS AN
    ONLINE MARKETPLACE.<br><br>
    
    YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CRREO DOES NOT SUPERVISE, SCOPE, DIRECT, CONTROL, OR MONITOR ANY MEMBER’S OR CONTENT
    CREATOR’S SOLICITATIONS, CONTENT, OR WORK, AND CRREO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY
    RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE CONTENT OR WORK DEMANDED OF OR RENDERED BY CONTENT CREATORS IN ANY MANNER,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF
    QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, OR CODE,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE PERTAINING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.<br><br>
    
    Any reference on the Site to a particular Content Creator being matched to a Member’s tastes or preferences is not a
    representation of CRREO. Rather, any such reference is a representation of a Content Creator that its areas of focus,
    expertise, reach, following, or other qualifications align with the needs or wants of the searching Member. Any such
    reference is not an endorsement, certification, or guarantee by CRREO of such Content Creator’s skills or qualifications
    or whether they are suitable for that Member’s goals or desires. Instead, any such reference is intended to be useful
    information for Members to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the suitability of Content Creators with
    whom they interact via the Site.<br><br>
    
    The Site enables connections between Content Creators and Members to allow Members to patronize the content of the
    Content Creators and to engage the Content Creators for the creation of custom content. CRREO is not responsible for the
    performance or communications of Content Creators or Members, nor does it have control over the quality, veracity,
    timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the information provided by Content Creators or
    Members, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever
    of any Content Creators or Members, or of any ratings or reviews provided by Content Creators or Members with respect to
    each other. CRREO makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of
    the communications of or between Members or Content Creators identified through the Site, whether in public or private,
    via on- or off-line interactions, or otherwise howsoever.<br><br>
    No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and us is
    intended or created by these Terms of Service, the Services provided by Us, or your use of the Site.</p>
    <h2>PML DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>PMLS ARE NOT REGISTERED SECURITIES UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND SECTION 12(G) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. PMLS ARE
    NOT OWNERSHIP OR MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN CRREO. BY ISSUING (AS CONTENT CREATORS) OR PURCHASING (AS MEMBERS) A PML, YOU
    ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE UNIQUE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN OUR CRREO MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY
    UNIQUE CONDITIONS SET FORTH BY THE ISSUING CONTENT CREATORS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR
    ANY HARMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OF RESULTING FROM A DISPUTE BETWEEN A PML HOLDER (A MEMBER) AND A PML ISSUER (A CONTENT
    CREATOR).</p>

    that you will not use the Site for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. You may not use the Site
    in any manner which could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Site or interfere with any other party’s use and
    enjoyment of the Site or their receipt of our Services. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or
    information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Site. <br><br>
    All content included on the Site, such as text, graphics, logos, or images, as well as the compilation thereof, and any
    software used on or in the Site, is either (i) the property of CRREO or its subsidiaries or affiliates or (ii) the
    property of the Content Creators who published it, and is, in any case, protected by copyright and other laws that
    protect intellectual property and proprietary rights. You agree to observe and abide by all copyright and other
    proprietary notices, legends or other restrictions contained in any such content and will not make any changes thereto. <br><br>
    You may not modify, publish, transmit, reverse engineer, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works,
    or in any way exploit any of the content, in whole or in part, found on or in the Site unless you are a Content Creator
    and, in any such case, only to the extent you own the content at issue. Our content is not for resale. Your use of the

    This license may be revoked by us at any time and for any reason, including, for example and without limitation, for
    failure to pay the agreed-upon price for any Services, subscription content, or PMLs, or for any other failure to abide
    by these Terms of Service. <br><br>
    Any content (including derivative works thereof) created by you through use of the Site or the Services, including, for
    example and without limitation, video content or promotional materials created using our Site or any video creation
    software or processes we make available to you, shall be owned by you, except that you hereby grant to us an
    irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive, global, non-transferable license to the same for the limited purpose of promoting
    the Site or the Services, with proper attribution or credit.</p>
    <h2>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>Certain services made available via CRREO or the Site may be delivered by third-party service providers. As described in
    our Privacy Policy, we strive to ensure that our third-party service providers keep to the same high standards of data
    handling as we do. Any contracts we enter into with our third-party service providers include the data protection
    principles enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and
    require that the third-party service provider adhere to those principles. However, we cannot guarantee compliance by any
    third-party with industry standards, laws, and regulations governing the collection, management, and use of such data.
    By using any product, service, or functionality of the Site, you hereby acknowledge and consent that we may share such
    information and data with any third party with whom we have a contractual relationship to provide the requested product,
    service, or functionality on behalf of Us, the Site, or the Users. The terms by which we may share such information and
    data are governed by our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>USE OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES</h2>

    which may be open to the general public or limited to Users, or other informational pages on which Users may post
    responses or replies that are visible to and accessible by the general public (collectively the “Interactive Content”).
    You agree to use the Interactive Content only in a manner proper and related to the particular Interactive Content.
    While use of the Site is generally governed by our Privacy Policy, you agree to be solely responsible for the
    dissemination and use by third parties of any information you voluntarily post or relay through use of or interaction
    with the Interactive Content. Such dissemination and use are beyond our ability to control and we therefore assume no
    responsibility for any loss, appropriation, or misuse of any such information. <br><br>

    parties. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action,

    <h2>MODIFICATIONS AND INTERRUPTIONS</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to, in our sole and absolute discretion, change or modify the Site, our Services, or the terms
    under which you may use either, or to suspend or discontinue the Site and our Services at any time or for any reason,

    caused by or resulting from discontinuance of the Site or our Services. <br><br>
    
    We cannot guarantee the Site will remain fully available without interruption. We may experience hardware, software, or
    other problems or need to perform routine maintenance on the Site, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. To the
    fullest extent provided by law, you agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or injury you
    experience due to your inability to use the Site as intended. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall obligate or be
    construed as obligating us to maintain and support the Site or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in
    connection therewith. <br><br>
    
    There are many factors outside of our control that may affect your experience with the Site or Services. For example,
    the content created by a Content Creator may fail to satisfy the desires of a Member who purchases it. To the fullest
    extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any loss, damage, or injury you may experience resulting from any
    User’s interaction with or professional relationship with any other User or with a non-user Content Creator, whether
    current or former, or from a User’s use of the Site or our Services in general.</p>
    <h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
    of California, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.</p>
    <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
    <p><u>Informal Negotiations</u> <br><br>
    
    To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to or arising out of these
    Terms of Service, your use of the Site, and/or the relationship between us (each a "<strong>Dispute</strong>" and collectively the
    “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) brought by either you or us (individually a “<strong>Party</strong>” and collectively the “<strong>Parties</strong>”), the Parties agree to
    first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty
    (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations shall commence upon written notice from one Party to
    the other. <br><br>
    
    <u>Binding Arbitration</u> <br><br>
    
    If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
    expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT
    TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL AND/OR JOIN CLAIMS WITH THE CLAIMS OF ANOTHER THROUGH THE USE OF A CLASS ACTION,
    CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial
    Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary
    Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("<strong>AAA Consumer Rules</strong>"), both of which are available at the AAA website
    (<a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>). To the fullest extent permitted by law, your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
    shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
    arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will
    provide a written decision along with their findings of fact and conclusions of law, if any. Except where otherwise
    required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the State of California. Any
    judgment rendered through arbitration shall be binding upon the Parties and such judgment may be submitted to and
    entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br><br>
    
    <u>Restrictions</u> <br><br>
    
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the fullest
    extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (2) there is no right or
    authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there
    is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
    public or any other persons. <br><br>
    
    <u>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</u> <br><br>
    
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
    and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
    intellectual property rights of a Party and (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
    invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use. <br><br>
    
    If this arbitration provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
    Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
    decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
    submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND OUR

    WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR OUR SERVICES, (3) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE
    SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (4) ANY INTERRUPTION OR
    CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE, (5) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE
    TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SITE BY ANY THIRD PARTY, (6) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT AND MATERIALS OR FOR
    ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT TRANSMITTED OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE
    VIA THE SITE OR OUR SERVICES, AND (7) ANY COMMUNICATIONS OR MATERIALS SENT TO YOU BY ANY OTHER USER OF THE SITE.</p>
    <h2>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent provided by law, in no event will we or our owners, directors, employees, agents, or vendors be
    liable to you or any third party, including other Users, for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental,
    special, or punitive damages, including lost profit, lost revenue, loss of data, or other damages arising from your use
    of the Site or our Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything
    to the contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the
    action, will at all times be limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to us during the six (6) month period prior to
    any cause of action arising. Certain state laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or
    limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers or limitations may not
    apply to you, and you may have additional rights.</p>
    <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
    <p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold CRREO (including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our
    respective officers, agents, partners, and employees) harmless from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or
    demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by you or any third party, including other Users, due to
    or arising out of: (1) your use of the Site or enjoyment or receipt of the Services, including any intentional,
    negligent, or reckless misuse thereof; (2) breach of these Terms of Service or any other agreement with us; (3) any
    breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service or other agreement with us; (4) your
    violation of the rights of a third party, including, for example and without limitation, copyright infringement or the
    infringement of another’s intellectual property rights; (5) your failure to pay us or any third party (including,
    without limitation, Content Creators) any amounts owed under these Terms of Service or any other agreement between you
    and such third party; or (6) any overt harmful act toward any other User or non-user Content Creator with whom you
    connected, interacted, or engaged via the Site or Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your
    expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you
    agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of
    any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.</p>
    <h2>USER DATA</h2>
    <p>We will maintain certain data that you transmit through use of the Site for the purpose of managing the performance of
    the Site or our current and future Services. Our collection, retention, use, and deletion of this and other data is
    described in greater detail in our Privacy Policy. Although we perform regular, routine backups of data, you are solely
    responsible for all data that you transmit or that relates to any activity you have undertaken using the Site. You agree
    that we shall have no liability to you for any loss or corruption of any such data, and you hereby waive any right of
    action against us arising from any such loss or corruption of such data.</p>
    <h2>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES</h2>
    <p>Creating an account on the Site, sending us emails, or completing online forms constitute electronic communications. You
    consent to receive electronic communications, and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
    communications we provide to you electronically, whether by email or SMS/MMS message, satisfy any legal requirement that
    such communication be in writing. You hereby agree to the use of electronic signatures, contracts, orders, and other
    records, and to electronic delivery of notices, policies, and records of transactions initiated or completed by us. You
    hereby waive any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances, or other laws in any
    jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic records, or to payments or
    the granting of credits by any means other than electronic means.</p>
    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy, and any other policies or operating rules provided by us
    to you in anticipation of providing the Services to you constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you
    and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service or other policies and
    operating rules shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service operate to the fullest
    extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
    responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.
    If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
    that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does not affect the validity
    and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Portions of these Terms of Service which by their nature would survive
    termination of the Site or our Services (e.g., disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification provisions) shall
    be deemed to survive any such termination. There exists no joint venture, partnership, employment, or other agency
    relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Service, your use of the Site, or your enjoyment
    or receipt of the Services. You agree that these Terms of Service will not be construed against us by virtue of having
    drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Service
    and the lack of physical signature by the parties hereto in order to execute these Terms of Service.</p>
