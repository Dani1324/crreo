    <h4>Last Revised: April 04, 2023</h4>
    <p>Here <strong>CRREO</strong> (also referred to herein as “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”), protecting your privacy is our priority. For this reason,
    we collect and use personal information only as it might be needed for us to provide our users (collectively our
    “<strong>Users</strong>”) access to our website and its features, payment platform, marketing and analytics tools, and content creation
    and publication features (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), to improve the user experience for you and other Users of the Site, and to
    provide Users with opportunities to discover and interact with each other (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>”). <br><br>
    Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe what data we collect, how we collect it, and how, when, and why we use your
    personal data. It also describes options we provide for you to access, update, or otherwise assume control of your
    personal data that we process. <br><br>
    By providing us with your personal information, you are consenting to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
    Please read it carefully. If you have any questions about our data collection or use practices or want to better
    understand your rights under this Privacy Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at <a href="mailto:dpo@crreo.co">dpo@crreo.co</a>. <br><br>
    If your content is listed on the Site without your knowledge or consent, please reach out to us as soon as possible at
    <a href="mailto:hello@crreo.co">hello@crreo.co</a> or follow the DMCA procedures outlined in our Terms of Service.</p>
    <h2>Compliance Statement</h2>
    <p>We at CRREO strive to uphold the highest standards of data and privacy protections. Regardless of where our customers
    are, we strive to adopt the principles and safeguards of both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the
    California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). Your individual rights may be determined by the laws and regulations of
    the state and country in which you reside. <br><br>
    <i>While we strive to materially comply with all federal, state, and local laws, you are personally responsible for
    ensuring that your use of the Site and our Services complies with all laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside.</i></p>
    <h2>How and why we collect your personal information</h2>
    <p>We at CRREO are defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a “data controller”. This means that we
    collect your personal information for our own use in order to provide you full access to the Site and to provide our
    Services to you or for your benefit. Most of the personal information we collect is provided directly by you when you
    create an account through the Site or when you otherwise provide information to us when registering for our Services.
    For example, we may collect your email address if you register for our mailing list. This information is used to send
    you emails via a general mailing list which you are voluntarily subscribing to. As another example, we may collect your
    name, email address, your chosen username and password, payment information, and verification of your age. This
    information is used to create your user account, to verify your eligibility to receive the Services, and to provide you
    with the Services. As another example, we may collect your location data to allow us to comply with federal, state, and
    local laws, to improve the Site, and to tailor future design implements to our Users’ unique needs. As one final
    example, we may collect information pertaining to your unique interests to tailor default behaviors of the Site and the
    information the Site displays to you by default.<br><br>
    Information you might be expected to provide includes, without limitation:<br><br>
    - Full Name<br>
    - Username<br>
    - Password<br>
    - Age range<br>
    - Email address<br>
    - Phone number<br>
    - Samples or examples of prior created content<br>
    - Credit card or other payment information<br>
    - Information relating to the content (or types of content) you are creating or seeking<br><br>
    
    We collect your personal information for the limited purpose of providing the Services to you and our other Users. We
    also collect your personal information to allow us to tailor our current and future Services to better meet your needs
    and preferences, as well as to better understand how you and others use the Site so as to refine it and create an
    ever-improving user experience. Lastly, we may collect your personal information to provide targeted advertisements to
    you based on criteria provided by selected advertisers. We do not market or sell your personal information to
    advertisers or to other third parties.</p>
    <h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>As you use and access the Site, we (including any third parties providing web design, hosting, and related services to
    us) may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect information, including, without limitation: <br><br>
    - <strong>Usage Information</strong>. The Site collects usage data such as the source address from which a page request originates (i.e.,
    your IP address, domain name, type of computer), date and time of the page request, the referring web site (if any), and
    other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use this data, for example, to better understand the Site usage
    in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Site users prefer based on the number of visits to those areas. This
    information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. It is not attributed to you as
    an individual – meaning log files are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser. <br><br>
    - <strong>Location Information</strong>. We collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are
    accessing the Site (e.g., your approximate geographic location as inferred from your IP address). This information may
    be used to, without limitation, verify your legal eligibility to use the Site or otherwise receive the Services. <br><br>
    - <strong>Cookies and Browser Information</strong>. The Site uses cookies for a variety of purposes as further described below and in our
    Cookie Policy. <br><br>
    - <strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a
    graphic image on a web page or in an e-mail message for the purpose of transferring data. We may use web beacons (or
    clear GIFs) on our Site or include them in the e-mail messages we send you for many purposes, including site traffic
    reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising e-mail auditing and reporting, and personalization. Information gathered
    through web beacons may be linked to your Personal Information. <br><br>
    - <strong>IP Addresses and Log Files</strong>. An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number assigned to each computer on a network to
    identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. We may keep track of IP addresses to troubleshoot
    technical concerns and to maintain the safety and security of our Site (e.g., by reviewing your IP address in
    combination with your Personal Information for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.) In addition, we may use IP
    addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track traffic patterns, and gather demographic information for
    aggregate use.</p>
    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>Our website may use “cookies” to help personalize and enhance your online experience. Cookies are small text files,
    generally made up of letters and numbers, that are placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other device when
    you visit a web page. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that
    issued the cookie to you. <br><br>
    When you visit a webpage and enter personal information (e.g., your name, email address, etc.), that information is
    packaged into a cookie which is then sent to your browser and saved for later use. On subsequent visits to the same
    website, your browser will send that cookie back to the web server that issued it, thus identifying you and the
    information you already provided to that website on previous visits. Cookies exist largely as a convenience feature,
    though websites and internet-based services may use cookies for purposes such as tracking customer use of their services
    and providing targeted advertising to customers based on the data contained in cookies. <br><br>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by activating the setting on your web browser that allows for you to
    refuse some or all cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but almost all web browsers allow
    for limiting cookies to select websites or declining cookies altogether. If you choose to decline cookies issued by our
    website or by all websites, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our website, including
    the ability to “log in” and remain logged in as a registered user. <br><br>
    For more information, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>
    <h2>Certain disclosures not covered by this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This list of personal information and our Privacy Policy does not include or contemplate information you voluntarily
    disclose through responses or replies to any blog or public forum that we may decide to implement in the future or that
    is provided by a User on their own website or other venue. When you make such disclosures, you are providing your
    personal information to any user or other third party with access to those features, including, potentially, the general
    public. Any use of such information by third parties is beyond our ability or responsibility to control. <br><br>
    We encourage you to review the privacy policies of websites you choose to visit so that you can understand how those
    other websites collect, use, and share your information. Here at CRREO, we take commercially reasonable steps to ensure
    that our data processing partners handle your personal information responsibly and in compliance with all applicable
    laws and regulations. However, we are not responsible for the privacy policies or other content of websites unrelated to
    or uncontrolled by CRREO, including, without limitation, Chekr, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Bing, and other
    websites owned, operated by, or created by third parties.</p>
    <h2>How and why we use your personal information</h2>
    <p>We strongly believe in using personal information only as necessary to provide you with our Services and with the best
    possible user experience. To that end, we may use your personal information to provide you with Services, to allow you
    to discover and reach out to other Users, to tailor our current and future Services to your needs by offering more
    relevant Services in the future, and to understand how you and others use our Site so that we can improve it and provide
    a better user experience for you and others. <br><br>
    We may share your data with our trusted partners, considered by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to be
    “data processors”, to help facilitate payments, perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, or provide
    technical support. Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are prohibited by contract from using
    your personal information for any purpose other than to provide these services to us or to you on our behalf, and such
    third parties are required by contract to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. <br><br>
    In order to tailor our services to your needs, we may use your personally identifiable information to inform you of
    other products or services available from us and our affiliates, including, potentially, other Users. We may also
    contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion on our current Services or potential new services that we
    may offer. We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving these communications. You may, at
    any time, opt out of receiving any or all marketing communications from us by writing to us at <a href="mailto:hello@crreo.co">hello@crreo.co</a>. <br><br>
    We will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that
    such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes to which CRREO may
    become a party; (b) protect and defend CRREO’ rights under the law; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect
    the personal safety of our other users or the general public. For example, if a visitor to our website submits a comment
    or inquiry through our website’s built-in contact form expressing an intent to cause physical harm to themselves or
    others, we may proactively inform law enforcement to protect the public interest.</p>
    <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We take great effort to secure your personal information and justify the trust you have placed in us. Our website and
    other data processes meet or exceed industry standards and include the use of at least 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer
    (SSL) protection. The use of SSL technology encrypts data transmitted between you and our website and other web
    services. When we transmit your personal information to other websites or web-based services (e.g., payment processors),
    it is similarly encrypted.</p>
    <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides rights to citizens and residents of the European Union (EU) to
    control their data. We encourage you to learn more about GDPR and, if applicable, better understand your rights by
    visiting the GDPR Portal at a <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank">https://www.eugdpr.org/</a>. The GDPR addresses our responsibilities in handling your personal
    data (also referred to in this Privacy Policy as your personal information). <br><br>
    Under GDPR and this Privacy Policy, you have the following rights: <br><br>
    <strong>1. Right to Access Personal Data.</strong> You have the right to access your personal data that has been collected by us. To
    exercise this right, please contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:dpo@crreo.co">dpo@crreo.co</a>. We will respond to any such request
    within thirty (30) days. <br><br>
    <strong>2. Right to Rectification.</strong> You have the right to request modification of your personal data to correct any errors or to
    update incomplete or inaccurate information. <br><br>
    <strong>3. Right to Erasure.</strong> You have the right to request that we stop using the personal data we collect from you, stop
    transmitting it to third-party data processors, and erase it from our records and databases. In most cases, we will
    simply grant this request. In some limited circumstances, such as when we are contractually required to provide Services
    to you and need the personal information we have collected to do so, we may delay granting your request until such time
    as it is feasible for us to stop using your personal data and erase it. We may also deny your request if your personal
    data is the subject of a valid law enforcement request or preservation and/or disclosure of your personal data is
    required by law or by order of a court of law. <br><br>
    <strong>4. Right to Restrict Data Processing.</strong> You have the right, in any of the following circumstances, to request that all
    processing of your personal data be stopped: <br><br>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>you wish to contest the accuracy of your personal data, in which case, we will suspend processing of your personal data for a period while we verify its accuracy;</li>
      <li>you believe the processing of your personal data is unlawful but you oppose the erasure of your personal data and request the restriction of its use instead;</li>
      <li>you believe we no longer need your personal data for our business purposes, but the personal data must be preserved for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or</li>
      <li>you have objected to our continued processing pursuant to Article 21 of the GDPR, in which case we will suspend processing of your personal data unless our legitimate need to continue processing it overrides your objection.</li>
    </ol><br>

    <strong>5. Right to be Notified.</strong> You have the right to be notified of any use of your personal data in a clear and simple manner.
    This Privacy Policy serves as notification to you of how we intend to collect and use your personal data. If you feel
    your rights are being impeded, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:dpo@crreo.co">dpo@crreo.co</a> to have your concerns
    addressed. In the event of any rectification or erasure of your personal data, we will provide you written notice within
    seventy-two (72) hours. Furthermore, in the event of a data breach that includes your personal data, we will inform you
    and the relevant legal authorities within seventy-two (72) hours after we are made aware of the breach. <br><br>
    <strong>6. Right to Data Portability.</strong> You have the right to request that your personal data be sent electronically to a third party
    of your choosing. The personal data must be provided by us in a commonly used, machine readable format if doing so is
    technically feasible. <br><br>
    <strong>7. Right to Object.</strong> You have the right to object to any denial by us of your request that we stop processing your data per
    your Right to Restrict Data Processing. <br><br>
    <strong>Right to Reject Automated Individual Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to refuse the automated processing of your
    personal data to make decisions about you if such decisions significantly affect you or produce legal effects concerning
    you.</p>
    <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>We may retain personal information collected from you or from third parties as described elsewhere in this Privacy
    Policy for an indefinite period of time unless you choose to exercise your Right to be Forgotten.</p>
    <h2>California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you are afforded special protections under the CCPA, which include: <br><br>
      <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>The right to request disclosure of our data collection and sales practices as they may apply or pertain to your data,
        including the categories of personal information we collect, the source of that information, our use of the information,
        and, if the information is to be or has been disclosed or sold to third parties, the categories of personal information
        that may be or was disclosed or sold to third parties and the categories of third parties to whom such information may
        be (or was) disclosed or sold (a “Personal Information Request”);</li>
        <li>The right to request a copy of the specific personal information collected about you during the twelve (12) months
        immediately prior to your request (also a “Personal Information Request”);</li>
        <li>The right to have any such information deleted, with limited exceptions;</li>
        <li>The right to request that your personal information not be sold to third parties; and</li>
        <li>The right not to be discriminated against because you choose to exercise any of your newly afforded rights under the
        CCPA.</li>
      </ol><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Information Requests</h2>
    <p>To submit a Personal Information Request or to request the erasure of your personal information per the terms of the
    CCPA, please contact us by using the form on our website’s “Contact Us” page or by emailing our Data Protection Officer
    at <a href="mailto:dpo@crreo.co">dpo@crreo.co</a>. Please note that the CCPA only affords California residents the right to make Personal Information
    Requests twice in a rolling 12-month period, we may require you to provide additional information to verify your
    identity prior to complying with any such request, and we will respond to any such request within forty-five (45) days
    of receiving it.</p>
    <h2>Categories of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>CRREO has collected the following categories of information within the past twelve (12) months or may reasonably expect
    to collect such information in the future: <br><br>
    <ol class="pointed-list">
      <li>Identifiers (e.g., your name, contact information, cookies)</li>
      <li>Information protected against security breaches (e.g., your name, financial account information, username, and password)</li>
      <li>Commercial information</li>
      <li>Internet/electronic activity</li>
      <li>Geolocation</li>
      <li>Audio/video data</li>
      <li>Professional or employment related information</li>
      <li>Education information</li>
      <li>Biometrics</li>
      <li>Inferences from the foregoing</li>
    </ol><br>
    We have collected and/or expect to collect information pertaining to each category from our Users (including you), from
    third-party websites and data providers (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+), and from the websites and
    social media profiles of vendors who have not themselves registered or created a profile on the Site. <br><br>
    We have not sold any such information within the past twelve (12) months and do not have any plans to sell such
    information in the future. <br><br>
    We have disclosed within the past twelve (12) months or reasonably expect to disclose in the future, for purposes of
    providing the Services and/or other business purposes as defined by the CCPA: identifiers, information protected against
    security breaches, protected classification information, commercial information, internet/electronic activity,
    geolocation, and inferences from the foregoing. We do not anticipate disclosing biometric data.
    </p>
    <h2>Sale of Personal Information; Opt-Out Process</h2>
    <p>The CCPA requires that any business which provides access to or discloses Personal Information to third parties for
    monetary or other valuable consideration must provide California residents with a web-based means of opting out of any
    such sale or disclosure. We at CRREO do not sell or otherwise provide such Personal Information to third parties except
    as otherwise required for us to provide the Services as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. If we, in the
    future, decide to sell or otherwise provide third parties access to Personal Information, we will update this Privacy
    Policy to include an opt-out process.</p>
