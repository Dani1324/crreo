        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <br>
        <p>- <span>Consent.</span> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- <span>Performance of a Contract.</span> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- <span>Legitimate Interests.</span> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 3vw;">- Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 3vw;">- Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>
        <br>
        <p>- <span>Legal Obligations.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
        <br>
        <p>- <span>Vital Interests.</span> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
        <br>
        <p>- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
        <br>
        <p>- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
        <br>
        <p>- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
        <br>
        <p>- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, <span>please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information </span>(see "<a href="#">WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a>" above), in the United States, and other countries.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>
        <br>
        <p>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
        <br>
        <p>We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the termination of the user's account.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>11. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <br>
        <p><span>In Short:</span> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@crreo.co</p>
